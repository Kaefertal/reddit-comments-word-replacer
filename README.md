reddit-comments-word-replacer
=============================

Searches for predefined words in Reddit posts and comments and replaces them.

To make this script work, just put reddit-bot.py, to_find and username_password in a folder on your computer. Then replace all the placeholders with your data. In reddit-bot.py these are things like "YOUR *** HERE". In to_find all the keywords have to be written in lowercase, while the replacements can be written normally. If you have more than one replacement for a keyword, just do like in the example. In username_password you just have to type your Reddit-username in the first line and your password in the second line. Finally, execute the script in your terminal or IDE.

The script still needs a good final test, but actually everything should work.
